# Chess
Software programming project which implies the development of a chess game. It comprises both a Player versus Player mode and a Player vs Computer one using the Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm. The Python programming language was chosen purely for the simplicity of implementation, this project being quite a simple one which requires little to no snappiness or performance.
