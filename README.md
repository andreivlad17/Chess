# Chess
Software programming project which implies the development of a chess game in different design patterns(MVP, MVC). It comprises both a Player versus Player mode, a Player vs Computer one and AI vs AI using the Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm. The Python programming language was chosen purely for the simplicity of implementation, this project being quite a simple one which requires little to no snappiness or performance at runtime(depending on the algorithm's depth).
